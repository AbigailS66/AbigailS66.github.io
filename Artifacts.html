Reflection for Essay: This showcases my strength because it is an assignment i got done in a limited amount of time, and it shows my ability to engage with several sources of information simultaneously, another Habit of Mind. I am very proud of how this essay, which was our first of the year, turned out.

Reflection for Math Test: I included this becuase it was something I probably could have done better on. I didn't get a bad grade on it, but had I aksed for more information or asked questions to fill in the gaps of what I didn't know (which are two Habuts of Mind) I probably could have done better than I did. This doesn't really show my biggest stretch, but it still shows a minor problem I have with asking questions. I also could have acheived a better grade by reading the question better for some of the questions, which is an annoying problem to have because it seems so easily avoidable when you get an assignment back.
