         <h3>  My SMART Goal  </h3>
    </center>
      <p> My SMART goal was to get all my work done in a timely manner. This goal was kind of split into two parts for me: working alone and working with peers.  To achieve this goal I have done my best to stay on track while working with peers and found music that helps me concentrate while working on homework. Going forward in the year with my goal, I will focus on concentrating on getting classwork and homework done in a timely manner. I can't do much more to work on working with peers to not get distracted, so working alone will be my purpose. </p>
      <h3>  My Stretch </h3>
      <p> My stretch this year was working with peers and friends without getting distracted, which is closely tied to my SMART goal. I think my stretch remains to be a stretch but has gotten better from the beginning of the year. Staying on task while working with peers is still hard for me but working with friends is easier to do without all of us getting distracted. </p>
   <h3> My Strength</h3>
    <p> My strength was staying on top of classwork and I think this strength has remained constant for me. I missed a lot of school going through my concussion in addition to other sicknesses I have had and I think staying on top of classwork helped me not get too behind.</p>

<h3> Mid-Year Reflection</h3>
     </center>
<ol>
     <li> Our friend group is not too broad, but it is comprised of people who have similar interests and enjoy hanging out with each other. As Isabel Lehmann said," Peers are not easily accepted into our friend group because we're weird and no one wants to hang out with
    us." </li>
    <br>
    <li> I think I've been a role model in hockey because I listen to my coaches and I always try my hardest. </li>
     <br>
     <li> I think I'm pretty consistent with getting work done on time. I just try to get my work done as soon as I get it and stay on top of longer-term projects. </li>
